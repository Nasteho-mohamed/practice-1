    <h1>Welcome Full Story About My Life</h1>
    <p>This explains the beginning of my life all the way to the end of my life. My life from the beginning was very fun as I grew up living with my mom’s  <br>
        friend  and my friend. But there were a lot of fights and I was very hyper back then. I have ADHD so back then when I was little; I was very hyper and <br>
        wouldn't stop moving around the place. I always was annoying back then and never seemed to get my homework done at school.  I was born at Kaiser Hospital <br>
        during the year 1996. The first place I lived was on the street Via Harriet and was right next to a train. It was always noisy when the train passed  <br>
        by because it shook the house and scared all the animals. It wasn’t the best place to live, but we eventually moved to the hills,  I don’t remember <br>
        Overall I know that I’m going to graduate because I’m pushing hard and all I need to finish is  my Cyber High and keep up my grades and I will graduate.  <br>
       I want to go to Chabot College because it’s the closest place to go toI am planning to get my associates degree then transfer to Cal State East Bay 
       University.  <br>I don’t exactly know the requirements of classes to get into Cal State, but as long as I get my AA degree I should be fine.
